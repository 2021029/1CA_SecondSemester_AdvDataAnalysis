Since the start of the industrial revolution in 1760 earths average has risen  faster than ever before this effect is known as global warming and it&#39;s caused by the increase of green house immersion(?)  from human activity  GREENHOUSE GASES occur naturally on our planet but human activities  such as the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, deforestation  and the decomposition of waste in landfills have increased  the amount of green house gases dramatically  green house gases act like a blanket around earth trapping the heat from the Sun&#39;s rays  this is called the green house effect  thanks to this effect  earth has just the right  temperature  for life to thrive on it unlike other planets in our solar system  however if the greenhouse effect becomes too strong it starts to cause issues  the increased  temperatures we are experiencing now are causing ice in the artic and Antarctica  as well as glaciers and snow around the world  to melt the water created by the melting ice pours into the oceans causing sea levels to rise this puts all islands in danger of disappearing  especially those in the Pacific and Caribbean ranges rising sea  levels  are also causing devastating floods in countries like China, indonesia,philippines, malaysia, and thailand not only are these floods a direct Hazzard  to humans but can also destroy crops and farms used to feed the population another effect  of the rising temperatures is that oceans warm up and evaporate faster than normal increasing the occurrence of severe storms and heavy rainfall global warming is making weather more  extreme  bringing longer droughts and heatwaves the loss of soil moisture  and the high temperatures increase the risks of wildfire too the high temperatures on both land and in our oceans  effect  earths delicate ecosystems many animals are forced to migrate  to other areas to survive  while others are  loosing their habits and dying  so can we do anything  to stop the effects of climate change  climate change has already reached a point that humanity has never experienceed before  however  the future of our planet  is in our hands communities must make smart choices and tackle this issue with  environmentally friendly actions  some solutions to limit global warming  include : switching from burning  fossil fuels to renewable and Greener energy  sources  like solar hydroelectric or wind energy  reducing the emissions  caused by  industryof transportation by investing into greener technology and limiting the deforestation of land and investing in more space efficient forms of agriculture  like vertical farming  these are all big solutions but there are also smaller things that you could easily do at home for example  recycling , composting your organic waste eating more vegetables and fruits and fewer meat and dairy products saving electricity and buying things that last longer or that can be reused people around the world are working together  to innovate engineer  and develop solutions for the issue of climate change <br>Bhutan  is the world&#39;s most  carbon-negative  country  Costa Rica  has achieved 99% renewable energy  and now China is the world leader in wind power  climate change is a global issue and our future depends on the actions we take today"

People like John Kerry are making a fortune on this scam. Now all the elites are taking your tax dollars telling you it will save the planet. Look up catastrophism.

I think every country knows about the solution but if these solutions are followed then don&#39;t you think the massive population will be left with no alternative. Please do not take me in a negative sense as I am mentioning on my personal experience. My cousin is a butcher and he is into this profession since childhood now all of a sudden he will be asked to leave his profession then I thing everyone associated with his output will be in a state of doldrums. He is supplying flesh to different organization and the supply in not in kgs but tonnes. it is the duty of every individuals to take the ownership then situation will come to a normal. Once I had a very rough argument with a chicken seller few years ago from then onwards I left consuming chicken, even during any occasion I would go for some other food item but not chicken. I think I did my part. If everyone takes the ownership then there will be a change sooner or later. Finally your video is an eye-opener and it should be brought to the notice of the legislature who can make some laws and the executive will have some binding effect.

The best way to do that is charge fossil fuel producers a steadily rising carbon fee and return all the money to everyone in equal shares each month.  That supports the high price that is necessary.  Use a CBAM to charge that price on imports from free-polluting countries to strongly encourage them to match the price.  The IPCC says we need a price of $135 per ton of CO2 by 2030 and rising $10 a year after to even have a chance to hold warming to 1.5ÀöC.  In addition to pricing carbon, a hundred other complementary policies are needed.  But any combination that fails to include a strong carbon price has no chance of reducing emissions as fast as we need for our safety.  Please learn about Carbon Fee and Dividend with Border Carbon Adjustments, and ask your elected leaders to pass legislation to do it now."

Data showed:<br><br>    &quot;Extremely high concentrations of methane (up to 8 ppm) in the atmospheric layer above the sea surface along with anomalously high concentrations of dissolved methane in the water column (up to 560 nM, or 12000% of super saturation).&quot;<br><br>One source of these emissions &quot;may be highly potential and extremely mobile shallow methane hydrates, whose stability zone is seabed permafrost-related and could be disturbed upon permafrost development, degradation, and thawing.&quot; Even if the methane hydrates are deep, fissures, taliks and other soft spots create heat pathways from the seabed which warms quickly due to shallow depths. Various mechanisms for such processes have been elaborated in detail.<br><br>The paper then posits the plausibility of a 50 Gigatonne (Gt) methane release occurring abruptly &quot;at any time.&quot; Noting that the total quantity of carbon in the ESAS is &quot;not less than 1,400 Gt&quot;, the authors wrote:<br><br>    &quot;Since the area of geological disjunctives (fault zones, tectonically and seismically active areas) within the Siberian Arctic shelf composes not less than 1-2% of the total area and area of open taliks (area of melt through permafrost), acting as a pathway for methane escape within the Siberian Arctic shelf reaches up to 5-10% of the total area, we consider release of up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of hydrate storage as highly possible for abrupt release at any time. That may cause ‚àº12-times increase of modern atmospheric methane burden with consequent catastrophic greenhouse warming.&quot;<br><br>So the 50 Gt scenario used by the new Nature paper does not postulate the total release of the ESAS methane hydrate reservoir, but only a tiny fraction of it.<br><br>The scale of this scenario is roughly corroborated elsewhere. A 2010 scientific analysis led by the UK&#39;s Met Office in Review of Geophysics recognised the plausibility of catastrophic carbon releases from Arctic permafrost thawing of between 50-100 Gt this century, with a 40 Gt carbon release from the Siberian Yedoma region possible over four decades.<br><br>Shakhova and her team have developed these findings from data derived from over 20 field expeditions from 1999 to 2011. In 2010, Shakhova et. al published a paper in Science based on their annual research trips which highlighted that the ESAS was a key reservoir of methane &quot;more than three times as large as the nearby Siberian wetland... considered the primary Northern Hemisphere source of atmospheric methane.&quot; Current average methane concentrations in the Arctic are:<br><br>    &quot;about 1.85 parts per million, the highest in 400,000 years&quot; and &quot;on par with previous estimates of methane venting from the entire World Ocean.&quot;<br><br>As the ESAS is shallow at only 50 metres, most of the methane being released is escaping into the atmosphere rather than being absorbed into water.<br><br>The existence of such shallow methane hydrates in permafrost - at depths as small as 20m - was confirmed by Shakhova in the Journal of Geophysical Research. There has been direct observation and sampling of these hydrates by Russian geologists in recent decades until now; this has also been confirmed by US government scientists."
